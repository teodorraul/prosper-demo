# Things I'd like to add:

-   Add some validation for the function_name
-   Add navigation blocking when changes are syncing
-   Remove edges from database, and just hold a parent attribute to each node
-   I Would bind directlyt ot he types generate by supabase
-   Add keyboard hotkeys for navigation, in 4 directions
-   There seems to be an issue with the `updated_at` column. Supa returns `400` even when it's in the exact same format as the `created_at`
-   mode the `DataExtractionPanel` code to the store
-   add some tooltips when hovering over the extracted data fields
-   Impement node reordering, at the same level.. (though the order field)
-   Fix some visual styles
-   Improve the visuals for the data extraction panel (from the sidebar)
    You can hold `spacebar` to drag around the editor
-   Select sibling on deletion
- Refactor `Colors` object into `Guidelines`, as it now includes other presets
