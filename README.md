# Things I'd like to add:

-   Add navigation blocking when changes are syncing
-   Remove edges from database, and just hold a parent attribute to each node
-   I Would bind directlyt ot he types generate by supabase
-   There seems to be an issue with the `updated_at` column. Supa returns `400` even when it's in the exact same format as the `created_at`
